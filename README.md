# 🎮 react-tic-tac-toe-game

Welcome to my React playground! 🌱

This project started as the classic **Tic Tac Toe tutorial** from the [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)—the one every beginner builds to get started. But instead of leaving it there, I decided to keep leveling it up as I learn new things in React.

Think of this repo as my **React learning diary**, where each feature I add is a chapter in the story.

## 📖 The Journey So Far

- **Day 1:** Built the basic Tic Tac Toe board — two players, X vs O. Simple and satisfying.  
- **Day 2:** Added winner detection (because endless ties aren’t cool).  
- **Day 3:** Implemented move history & time travel — undo/redo moves and revisit past states like a time wizard. ⏳✨

---

## ✅ Current Features

- Classic 3×3 Tic Tac Toe gameplay (2 players).  
- Winner highlighting and draw detection.  
- Move history with time travel (jump to previous moves).  
- Clean, component-driven structure (Square, Board, Game).

## 🔮 Planned / Upcoming Features

Every time I learn a new React topic, I’ll try to plug it into this game. Some ideas on my radar:

- 🎨 Improved theming & styling (Tailwind / CSS Modules / styled-components).  
- 🤖 An AI opponent so I can lose to my own code.  
- 🌙 Dark mode (because every app deserves it)  
- 📱 A responsive UI for mobile players.  
- 💾 Save/load game state using `localStorage`.  
- 🏆 Score tracking across rounds.  
- 🔗 Maybe… online multiplayer?! (future boss level).
